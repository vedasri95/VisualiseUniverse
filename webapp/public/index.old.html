          <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
          <p>Our understanding of the Universe we inhabit and how it has progressed in its 13.7 billion year lifespan is primarily driven by cosmological simulations. These simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe usually simulate dark matter, a type of matter that neither absorbs nor emits light, but is believed to account for most of the matter in the Universe. Its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational interaction with visible matter.</p>
          <p>These simulations require a large number of particles, on scales as large as 10240<sup>3</sup>. Visualizations are desired for these particles and the structures they form through gravitational interactions over time. Structures are typically identified via "halo finding". Dark matter halos are components of a galaxy that are roughly spherical, extending from some main visible component of the galaxy. These halos can represent galaxies or clusters of galaxies. Substructures in these halos may be identified as smaller halos, representing galaxies. The interactions of these structures and substructures shape the structure of the Universe as a whole. Thus, visualizing the transitions these halos go through can provide great insight to the history and future of our Universe.</p>
          <p>The goal of this project is to create a tool to visualize this data set.</p>


          <h1 id="tasks">Tasks</h1>
          <h2>Initial data integration and browsing</h2>
          <p>The raw particle data from the Dark Sky simulations has been made available as SDF files. In addition to the raw particle data, Halo Catalog data, and a third dataset linking the Halo Catalogs to create a Merger Tree database will be available. A framework to ingest, process, and organize this data should be created.</p>

          <h2>Halo identification and visualization</h2>
          <p>The particles that compose a halo are defined by mass, position, and velocity. The halo finding process takes these particles as input and produces an additional set of properties for the halo. Each halo is collapsed into a single row of data, with columns corresponding to each data point.</p>
          <p>Over time, halos can move, merge, or split apart. Merger trees are used to describe the evolution of a halo at any given time. The goal of this task is to visualize the evolution of a halo over time.</p>

          <h2>Diving Deep into Halo Substructure</h2>
          <p>Provide a way to visualize and compare the substructure of individual halos. Characteristics such as mass, velocity, and acquisition time of particles should be comparable among substructure components.</p>

          <h2>Tying Everything Together</h2>
          <p>Merge the results of the tasks above into a single unified visualization tool that allows a user to explore the data from the Dark Sky simulations.</p>

          <h1 id="data">Data</h1>
          <p>The raw particle data from the Dark Sky simulations is available in SDF files. Halo Catalog and Merger Tree data sets generated using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gfcstanford/rockstar" target="_blank">Rockstar</a> are also available, in tabular ASCII format. A relatively small (11GB) dataset generated by a 128^3 particle simulation has been provided for initial development.</p>
          <p>Visualization methods will be developed and tested locally using this smaller dataset. The full raw particle data set is 31TB in size. After visualization methods have been developed, the Blue Waters supercomputer will be used to run these visualizations on a larger data set.</p>

          <h1 id="software">Software</h1>
          <p>The software developed will be primarily written in Python, utilizing libraries such as <a href="http://yt-project.org/" target="_blank">yt for SDF file loading and simple exploratory visualizations</a>, and VTK and Paraview libraries for more complex visualizations. Blue Waters has support for yt and Paraview as well.</p>
          <p>yt has built in support for basic volume rendering and it is possible to produce videos by generating a sequence of plots.</p>

          <h1 id="vis-design">Visualization Design</h1>
          <p>I will be working first on a visualization method that identifies and shows the evolution of the halos over time. Subsequently, I will work on an interactive tool that allows users to zoom into individual halos and compare their structure.</p>

          <h1 id="results">Expected results and evaluation</h1>
          <p>I have downloaded the sample datasets and experimented with some yt examples, such as simple Projection Plots:</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>There are also some visualization examples in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/darkskysims/darksky_catalog">darksky_catalog</a> repository which I've been looking at.</p>
