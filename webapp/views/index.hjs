            <p>The motivation behind doing this project is our curiosity in space and universe. We are excited to show visualizations of our grand galaxy.</p>
            <p>Cosmological simulations are a cornerstone of our understanding of the Universe during its 13.7 billion year progression from small fluctuations that we see in the cosmic microwave background to today, where we are surrounded by galaxies and clusters of galaxies interconnected by a vast cosmic web. These simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe usually simulate dark matter, a type of matter that neither absorbs nor emits light, but is believed to account for most of the matter in the Universe. Its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational interaction with visible matter.</p>
            <p>Dark matter halos are components of a galaxy that are roughly spherical, extending from some main visible component of the galaxy. These halos can represent galaxies or clusters of galaxies. Substructures in these halos may be identified as smaller halos, representing galaxies. The interactions of these structures and substructures shape the structure of the Universe as a whole. Thus, visualizing the transitions these halos go through can provide great insight to the history and future of our Universe.</p>
            <p>The goal of this project is to create a tool to visualize this data set, as outlined in the <a href="http://darksky.slac.stanford.edu/scivis2015/">SciVis Contest 2015</a>.</p>
