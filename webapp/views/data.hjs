              <p>The raw particle data from the Dark Sky simulations is available in SDF (self-describing data format) files. Halo Catalog and Merger Tree data sets generated using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gfcstanford/rockstar" target="_blank">Rockstar</a> are also available, in tabular ASCII format. A relatively small (11GB) dataset generated by a 128^3 particle simulation, consisting of snapshots of the data over time, has been provided for initial development. A paper describing the dark sky simulation and results in detail is available <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2600v1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://darksky.slac.stanford.edu/simulations/ds14_a/" target="_blank">full dataset</a> for the final state of the simulation is much larger at 31TB. Fewer simulations were done with this dataset since it only contains a single snapshot in time.</p>
