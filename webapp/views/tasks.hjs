            <h2>Initial data integration and browsing</h2>
            <p>The raw particle data from the Dark Sky simulations has been made available as SDF files. In addition to the raw particle data, Halo Catalog data, and a third dataset linking the Halo Catalogs to create a Merger Tree database will be available. A framework to ingest, process, and organize this data will be created.</p>

            <h2>Particle Visualization</h2>
            <p>To get a better sense of the particle data itself, I will create 2D and 3D visualizations, experimenting with various color mappings and attributes.</p>

            <h2>Halo Identification and Visualization</h2>
            <p>The particles that compose a halo are defined by mass, position, and velocity. The halo finding process takes these particles as input and produces an additional set of properties for the halo. Each halo is collapsed into a single row of data, with columns corresponding to each data point. The goal of this task is to visualize the evolution of a halo over time.</p>
